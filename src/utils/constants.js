const pOverview = `
I'm a mechatronics engineer and a Full-stack developer with over 4 years of software development experience.

Software quality, turn-around time, and client satisfaction are my main goals.

Always learning, especially in the Software world where new tech pops up every other day, so as to stay on top of the current trends and practices.

Studied at Abiola Ajimobi Technical University, where I received honor prizes during my whole student career, a regional Award of Excellency, and the Highest Overall Score in the mechatronics engineering school, I was the valedictorian representing the school of engineering in the graduation class of December 2022.

I'm a "get the job done" kind of person, and I like to maintain high levels of communication with my clients to make sure our mental models of the project stay in alignment.

My skillset encompasses, but is not limited to, the following technologies, frameworks, and languages:

For front-end development:

- Nextjs
-ReactJS, with Redux and React-router, Hooks, and Context API as well.
- Redux using Redux-Sagas, Redux-thunk.
- HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, mainly ES6/7.
- CSS Preprocessors as SASS/LESS, and postCSS.
- Bootstrap and Bulma as CSS frameworks.
- Testing suites such as Jest, Mocha, and Detox.

Back-End:
- Node JS with ExpressJS.
- Firebase Functions written in node

Databases:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- GraphQL-related technologies like Graphcool (BaaS)


Other skills:
- Docker
- Developing CI systems, mainly with GitlabCI and Github actions.
- Automatic deployment to platforms like Heroku
- Facebook application handling and development
- Git

I can natively speak English.

I look forward to the experience of working with you on a project; I like to keep it friendly and always push harder and harder, focusing on enhancements, efficiency, and UX.
